The purpose of this project was to use machine learning to detect traffic signs. Our object detection model used Faster RCNN object detection model as the pretrained model. The original model itself was trained on the COCO dataset and can detect 90 types of object. For the purpose of this project, however, we continued to train the model using our own dataset to detect Finnish traffic signs. The training was done using TensorFlow Object Detection API.

This repository contains the object detection model that we trained as well as the program (object_detection_main.py) used to perform the detection process itself.
